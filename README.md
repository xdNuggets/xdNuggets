# Introduction
I'm Josh, a 17 year old developer. I'm currently in my last year of high school, hoping to pursue Computer Science in college. I've always been a gamer, and have wanted to be a game developer for the longest time. 
In my free time I like to make little hobby projects on whatever interests me. I learned Java for the sake of Minecraft Plugin Development, Kotlin because its the better Java,
Python for discord bots and data analysis (plus it helps for school), and I am currently learning a wide range of backend programming languages such as Go and JavaScript, with plans to learn C++ or Rust.
One thing that I am really bad at is sticking to one project. One little mistake will have me demotiviated (my report system has had 4 rewrites because I forgot something really important) and giving up instantly.
