# Introduction
Hey! My name is Josh, previously known as Nuggets, and I'm a passionate developer focusing on Java by making Minecraft related addons, such as plugins or mods! I plan to learn React or Vue, . I'm really into aesthetic and smooth things, so if I see smooth tranisitions, effects, even rounded corners, I will fanboy over them. I love good looking unix setups
